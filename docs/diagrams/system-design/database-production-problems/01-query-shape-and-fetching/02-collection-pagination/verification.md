# Verification — Collection fetch join and pagination

**Status: source-reviewed teaching scenario.** The exact Java/MongoDB/DynamoDB fragments in this chapter have not been compiled or executed as application integration tests. Related synthetic PostgreSQL tests, where executed, are listed separately in the [atlas evidence report](../../VERIFICATION.md). A related SQL assertion does not prove this whole integration.

## Proposed deterministic check

Seed roots with different child counts; assert root count, unique IDs and complete children. Inspect SQL rows fetched. Turn on Hibernate fail_on_pagination_over_collection_fetch in a dedicated test to catch accidental regression.

## Expected result

Return 20 distinct roots with complete children and stable ordering.

## Observed result

No chapter-specific integration run is claimed. Record runtime versions, fixture setup, input, failure injection, actual assertions, cleanup and result here when the exercise is executed. Test the wrong variant too: the check should fail for the intended reason, then pass with the correction.

## Independent variation

Change one assumption: add a competing writer, a retry, a missing value, a larger dataset, or a crash at the relevant boundary. Predict the result before running. Evidence from copied code is not independent understanding.
